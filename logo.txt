Create a modern and dynamic logo for the k8s-parallel-exec project that represents the essence of parallel command execution in Kubernetes clusters. The design should feature a stylized version of the Kubernetes logo, with multiple arrows branching out from the central hexagon, symbolizing parallelism and efficient distribution of tasks. Incorporate vibrant colors, such as bright cyan or green, to evoke a sense of speed and agility. Overlay the arrows with a subtle command line terminal icon to emphasize the CLI aspect of the tool. The project name "k8s-parallel-exec" should be displayed in a bold, contemporary font beneath the main logo.
